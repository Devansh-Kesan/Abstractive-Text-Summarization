# About Previous Used DataSet: Scisumm_Net Dataset

### We have Uploaded the formed Csv (clean_dataset.csv) and Raw Dataset (Raw Dataset)

## Issue in Dataset
### According to Dataset_Documentation.txt inisde Raw Dataset we formed our Csv file. Where it was  Mention to take Abstract Part of Xml file, Clean Citing Sentences and Authority scores from citing_sentences_annotated.json as Input and to evaluate on Annotated Gold Summary

### So We observed on Training T5 model on this Dataset it was giving abstractive Summary. So we Analysed the Dataset where we found the total input text and output text , more precisely the abstract and Gold Summary were closely same.

### If you want to download Dataset in folder format Link:
